# what this app uses
Learned how to create a RESTful api from this tutorial: https://medium.com/@dinyangetoh/how-to-build-simple-restful-api-with-nodejs-expressjs-and-mongodb-99348012925d

Used: Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

# what this app actually does
Really this app uses a Schema to create a simple af document with 2 properties. You can create and view documents and that's about it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
